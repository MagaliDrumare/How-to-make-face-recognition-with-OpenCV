Video 1- Viola-Jones algorithm 
2001 cv2 
2 parts : Training , Detection 
GREYSCALE 
Detection / Looking for some feature of the face : 2 eyes, 1 noise, 1 mouse. Scan the image, create several green boxes of detection. 

Video 2- Haar-like Features 
-Edge features 
-Line features 
-Four rectangle features 

Look at in the GREYSCALE FEATURE 
Mouse = Line features 
Eyebrow = Edge features 
Noise (both size) = Edge feartures 
Eyes = Line features 

Edge features 
~ 0 withe (0.1, 0.2, 0.3.....)
~1 black (0.4, 0.6, 0.7.......)
average intensity of all the pixels 
W=0.166
B=0.568 
soustract B-W =0.402 
if B-W ~0.402 can be a potention noise 

Video 3- Integral Image 
Same size of the initial image 
Rectangle: everything left 
Sum all the value on the left 
4 operations against 12 

Video 4-Training Classifiers 
Which features are important? 
Reduce the size of the images : 24x24 px dimension 
labbeled as Face image / Non-Face Images (high rate of false postive identigy faces but they are not faces)

Video 5- Why Adaboost ? 
Too much features to detect 
180.000 + features in a 24X24 px 
huge number 
180.000 for all the images in the training images.....nightmare, too long 
Add weak classifier to make a string classifier. 
Increase the importance of the images that was not well classified. 
Minimum the error rate. Optimize the rate of good classification. 

Video 6- The Cascade 
Step 1 : If the top five features are not presents we reject Sub-Window
Next 12 features at step 2
